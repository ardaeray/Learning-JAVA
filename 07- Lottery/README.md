Write a program that randomly generates a lottery of a two-digit number, prompts the user to enter a two-digit number, and determines whether the user wins according to the following rule:

• If the user input matches the lottery in exact order, the award is $10,000.
• If the user input matches the lottery, the award is $3,000.
• If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery, the award is $1,000.

Example:

Enter your lottery pick (two digits): 31

The lottery number is 51

Match one digit: you win $1,000


Enter your lottery pick (two digits): 72

The lottery number is 21

Match one digit: you win $1,000


Enter your lottery pick (two digits): 96

The lottery number is 69

Match all digits: you win $3,000


Enter your lottery pick (two digits): 69

The lottery number is 69

Exact match: you win $10,000
