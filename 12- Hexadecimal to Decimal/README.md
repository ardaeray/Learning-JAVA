How do you convert a hexadecimal number to a decimal number?

Hexadecimal Number:     	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F

Equivalent Decimal:	        0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15


Start from the last and multiply the equivalent decimal value with the powers of 16. For the first one (I mean the last) you need to multiply the equivalent decimal value of the hexadecimal value with 16^0. For the second one (I mean the second from the last), you need to multiply the equivalent value with 16^1. And it neds to be keep going by increasing the power value by 1. At the end, you need to get summation of all of them.

Example:

Enter the Hexadecimal value you want to convert to Decimal here: A0

Decimal: 160
