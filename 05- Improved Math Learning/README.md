This example creates a program to teach a first grade child how to learn subtractions.
The program randomly generates two single-digit integers number1 and number2 with number1 >= number2 and displays a question such as “What is 9 – 2?” to the student.
After the student types the answer, the program displays whether the answer is correct.

Example:

What is 2 - 1 = 1

True

What is 1 - 0 = 0

False
