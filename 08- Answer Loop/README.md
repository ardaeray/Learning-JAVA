Write a program that prompts the user to enter an answer for a question on addition of two single digits.
Using a loop, you can now rewrite the program to let the user enter a new answer until it is correct.

Example:

What is 4 + 9? 1

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 2

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 3

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 4

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 5

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 6

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 7

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 9

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 11

Wrong answer. Try again. What is 4 + 9? 13

You got it!
