Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.
The program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number matches the randomly generated number.
For each user input, the program tells the user whether the input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next input intelligently.
Here is a sample run:

Guess a magic number between 0 and 100

Enter your guess: 50
Your guess is too high

Enter your guess: 25
Your guess is too low

Enter your guess: 38
Your guess is too low

Enter your guess: 45
Your guess is too high

Enter your guess: 42
Your guess is too low

Enter your guess: 44
Your guess is too high

Enter your guess: 43
Yes, the number is 43
